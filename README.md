## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I am passionate about designing and building **robust systems from the ground up** — from operating system enhancements to reliable network protocols and information retrieval engines. My work spans:  

- **Operating Systems** – extending xv6 with signals, schedulers, and memory management.  
- **Networking** – implementing TCP/UDP-like reliable transport, SDN controllers, and congestion control.  
- **Compilers & Tools** – building custom parsers, interpreters, and schematic editors.  
- **Full-Stack Development** – professional experience in SEO optimization, UI/UX improvements, and scalable web applications.  

I enjoy solving complex engineering problems, contributing to impactful projects, and continuously exploring new technologies.

## 🔑 Highlights  

- **M.Tech Thesis – Thought2Design**  
  Designed an interactive **PCB design platform** integrating natural prompts, 2D schematic editor, 3D visualization, gesture-based interaction, real-time validation, and collaborative editing.  

- **Networking Systems**  
  - Implemented TCP- & UDP-like client-server protocols with socket programming.  
  - Built SDN controllers (Hub, Learning Switch, Spanning Tree, Shortest Path, congestion-aware routing).  
  - Developed TCP-like UDP transport with ACKs, retransmissions, Reno & CUBIC congestion control.  

- **Operating Systems (xv6, C)**  
  - Added shell extensions (authentication, history, syscall control).  
  - Implemented custom signals and a priority-boosting scheduler with profiling.  
  - Designed adaptive page swapping with proactive replacement policies.  

- **Programming Languages & Systems**  
  - LaTeX → Markdown converter using Flex & Bison (C++).  
  - 2D Metal Slug–style action game with multi-level design (Unity3D, C#).  
  - Mini Web Browser with custom HTML parser, DOM renderer, and multi-process tab support (C++, Qt).  

- **Information Retrieval (C++)**  
  - Built a Boolean Retrieval Engine on the TREC CORD-19 dataset.  
  - Implemented AVL trees and hash tables from scratch for indexing.  
  - Integrated variable-byte and delta compression for compact, lossless indexing.  

- **Industry Experience – Cognizant (Cigna, Express Scripts)**  
  - Improved SEO (CSS minification reduced size by 25%, boosting search rankings).  
  - Rolled out new logo & favicon across Cigna websites, ensuring brand consistency.  
  - Revamped Cigna Middle East website (150+ bilingual pages, blog automation, new UI components).  
  - Enhanced Express Scripts system by fixing claim logic and improving efficiency by 20%.
